Prerequisite:

Set DVMT to 96MB (0x3)
Source =  FireWolfâ„¢s guide
Steps to change the DVMT value (Done on Windows or WinPE) 

1) Universal BIOS Backup ToolKit 2.0.exe - to backup the BIOS (DellInc.-1.5.3.rom) 
    At time of writing - BIOS version 1.5.3

2) UEFITool.exe to find the module labeled Setup and extract the PE32 image section (setup.bin)
  Update:

  For Dell Only: Search with this GUID then extracting the PE32 body under it would be faster /easier than finding the module per guide

          899407d7-99fe-43d8-9a21-79ec328cac21

3) Universal IFR Extractor.exe to extract setup.bin to a readable text file

4) Use notepad to search for Ã¢â‚¬Å“DVMTÃ¢â‚¬ in the text file,  2 were found at 0x432 and 0x433

    Both with value of 0x1 but only 0x432 needs to be set to 0x3

5) Format a USB drive to fat32 and create a folder name EFI (SD Card works too)

6) Download the EFI Shell and extract the Boot folder into the newly created EFI folder

     i.e.. /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi

7) Boot system with the USB and select UEFI Boot

ðŸ˜Ž At the grub prompt, enter these commands, hit enter after each command, then exit and reboot

    setup_var 0x432 0x3

    

To verify, just enter setup_var 0x432 and hit enter, the value will be listed

Note: Settings will retain after BIOS update but will reset if you select "Restore Settings" in BIOS!!!

 

BIOS Settings:

Set to "Load Default", Apply, then set the following:
TPM = Disabled
Secure Boot = Disabled
UEFI = Enabled
SATA Operation = AHCI
Wake on Lan /WLan = Disabled
Enable Legacy Option ROMs = Enabled
(If Ethernet doesn't load, try disabling it instead)
